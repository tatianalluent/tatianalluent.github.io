	<p>Formerly an Assistant Professor of Strategy and the Volkswagen Group Junior Chair for Diversity in Organizations at ESMT Berlin, I now work at the OECD researching the gender dimension of energy reforms in the Western Balkans.
	<p>My main research interest lies in understanding the sources of persistent forms of gender inequality in the economy. I study the social and organizational processes that produce and perpetuate gender inequality in outcomes such as career advancement, wages, and participation in entrepreneurship. I am interested in understanding how gender norms and stereotypes emerge and evolve at the cultural, organizational and individual levels and how these affect access to economic resources and opportunities.</p>
	<p>I hold a PhD in Business Administration from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, an MBA from ESSEC Business School and a Master’s Degree in Environmental and Energy Economics from IFP School. Prior to joining Fuqua’s Doctoral Program, I worked as a sustainability consultant for EY in Paris.</p>
