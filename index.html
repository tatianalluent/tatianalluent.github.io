	<p>A trained social scientist, after 9 years of academic research on inequalities within organizations, I transitioned to policy work, first at the OECD and then at Bpifrance, the French public investment bank. My focus has been on economic, industrial, and technological policy issues.</p>
	<p>I continue to teach a course on diversity in organizations in the MBA program at ESMT, the Berlin-based business school where I previously held an appointment as Assistant Professor.</p>
	<p>The focus of my academic research was the sources of persistent forms of gender inequality in the economy. I studied the social and organizational processes that produce and perpetuate gender inequality in outcomes such as career advancement, wages, and participation in entrepreneurship. My interest lay in understanding how gender norms and stereotypes emerge and evolve at the cultural, organizational and individual levels and how these affect access to economic resources and opportunities.</p>
	<p>I hold a PhD in Business Administration from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, an MBA from ESSEC Business School and a Masterâ€™s Degree in Environmental and Energy Economics from IFP School.</p>
